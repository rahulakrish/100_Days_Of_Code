"""

The secret is to have Reeborg follow along the right edge of the maze, turning right if it can,
going straight ahead if it canâ€™t turn right, or turning left as a last resort.

If right is clear, then Reeborg moves. You then use the front_is_clear to see if he comes up against a wall.
If so, then he turns left and the loop starts from the beginning.
