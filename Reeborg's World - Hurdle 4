"""

Challenge is to solve for Variable hurdle heights.
All the logic is in the jump() function.
You keep checking if you have wall on the right, and if so, keep moving forward.
If not turn right, move, turn right again and move downward.
If you reach a wall at the end, thenn turn left and start the whole loop again.

Initially, you check to see if there is a wall in front.
If not, you move
